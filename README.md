Enigmatic is a multiplayer real time strategy game about code breaking and encryption.

It's currently in development, but you can play [here](http://enigmatic-game.herokuapp.com/).

It's written entirely in Node, and then `game.js` is browserified. The server and the client share both the game update method and all behaviours.
